! Rubiskell

!! What's this?
Rubiskell allows you to call haskell function from ruby script.

Note: this project is not active any more. 
Try Unbabel (http://github.com/yhara/unbabel) instead.

!! Example
  require 'rubiskell'

  FIB = <<EOD
  fib :: Int -> Int
  fib 0 = 0
  fib 1 = 1
  fib n = fib (n-2) + fib (n-1)
  EOD

  fib = Haskell.new(FIB)
  puts "fib 5 is #{fib.run(5)}." 

you can also write fib[5] instead of fib.run(5).

!! How to run RSpec
 $ spec spec/spec_rubiskell.rb

Note: This may fail when you are using GNU Screen.
